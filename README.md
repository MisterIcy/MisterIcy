Hello! I am Alexandros Koutroulis, a seasoned PHP developer from Greece, currently working for [Epignosis Learning Technologies](https://www.epignosishq.com/)! I also write short or longer stories, for the harsh side of reality, we all have experienced at a point in our lives. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a weird personal project in PHP8.0. After ten years of authoring, I think it is high time I build my own tools for keeping notes, tracking stories, exploring the backgrounds of my characters and store a ton of meta-data. May or may not release. May or may not convert to Rust.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Rust](rust-lang.org/) and rediscovering [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B20)
- ðŸ¤” I wrote my first lines of code in VB4.0, back in 1995. Damn, that's a lifetime ago!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. If it's computer related, I will probably have a story to share. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **Malaka!**
